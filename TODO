Fix admin login
  doesn't call JS function

Allow-Control-Allow-Origin
  NOW: Extension -> EdNerd -> Lightspeed -> EdNerd -> extension
  WHY: extension needs to get AJAX request and parse it
    from Light speed Systems

make admin page
  choose what categories to allow / block
  view accessed categories
    add new category to sync list on request
